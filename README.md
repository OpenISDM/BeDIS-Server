# BeDIS-Server

BeDIS aims to support location-specific, active emergency preparedness and responses within large buildings. BeDIS also contains a virtual repository of data and information on the building, interior layouts and facilities. The repository, referred to hereafter as BeDI Mist, is structured according to the approaches of fog and mist computing. BeDIS also provides administrator to monitor the status of numerous Lbeacons in the large building.
